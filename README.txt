This program proposes a solution to a problem similar to that of the Traveling Salesman.
There are 40 different packages that each need to be delivered to one of 27 different addresses
by the end of the day. There are also 3 total delivery trucks, but only 2 drivers. Truck 3 cannot
depart until truck 1 or truck 2 has returned. Some packages need to be delivered by a certain
deadline and others must be delivered on a particular truck. The trucks cannot exceed 140 miles
of travel IN TOTAL.

I used the "Nearest Neighbor" approach for this application. The user can run the program to view
details regarding the status of a specific package, all packages, or all trucks at any specific
time of day.
